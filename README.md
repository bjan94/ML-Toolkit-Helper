# ML-Independent-Study
Machine learning notes, exercises and projects  
**Contents will be updated as I explore more topics**

### Machine Learning Notes
Basic theory of each topic will be in .md format. At the moment, this is only pure theory without any mathematical exploration.

### Images
Folder that will store all the images to be included in the notes

### Linear Regression
Exercise using simulated U.S. housing dataset.
Project exploring *ecommerce* dataset.

### Logistic Regression
